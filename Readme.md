Comparison of different classification algorithms of machine learning on sample credit user data to determine if a given credit request is high or low risk

Script uses different sklearn algorithms on the same cleaned and scaled data. Comparison of the different algorithms, and ensemble methods determined by recall values, accuracy and geometric mean score. Resampling script has examples of how to managed unbalanced data sets.

Algorithms used and compared:
- Simple logistical regression
- Oversampling
- Undersampling
- SMOTE
- Combination
- Random Forest
- Easy Ensembled classifier


Script is meant for training/educational purposes and will use panda and numby (will have to be pip installed)
